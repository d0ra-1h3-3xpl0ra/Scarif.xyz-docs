This can be hosted for example on: Custom Backend (consumer grad GPUs) Google Cloud Run Azure Container Apps AWS Apprunner The docker microservice is easy to reproduce and host locally for anyone who wants to participate in the network. The application can be called via REST API, i.e. from curl, Typescript, Python, etc.really anything that can make POST requests. An example query includes a \"prompt\" parameter, and a \"seed\" parameter. The prompt parameter is constant amongst a set of applications and can be changed. The seed parameter is solely set through reproducible, publicly avaiable parameters that are stored on the blockchain. These may include An example request: curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"seed\": 42, \"prompt\": \"Peaky Blinders NFT. Faces are not directly visible. No text.\"}' http://127.0.0.1:2500/predict The corresponding response: { \"response\": <UTF-8 Base64 Encoded Bytestring Of PNG Image> } The Smart contract can then (1) generate and then store the image on arweave, or (2) verify the base64 string with the image that is on arweave In other words, the REST POST arguments are \u201cseed\u201d (you can map any bytes to an integer), and a prompt. Make sure that the prompt is relatively short (i.e. not GPT4-long). In this case, the model runs locally on localhost, but technically the model could run anywhere.

Unlike traditional centralized approaches, decentralized AI leverages blockchain technology to create distributed networks where data and computational resources are shared securely and transparently. This fosters collaboration, reduces reliance on single points of failure, and enhances privacy and data ownership. Decentralized AI holds the promise of democratizing access to AI technologies, enabling innovation across various sectors while addressing concerns around data privacy and monopolistic control. Our project focuses on exploring the intersection of decentralized AI and generative art. While decentralized AI presents numerous opportunities, we recognize the inherent challenges in directly hosting machine learning models on the blockchain. As an initial step in this direction, we are channeling our efforts into verifying the origin of AI-generated content, particularly in the context of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). By establishing methods to authenticate the source of AI-generated NFTs, we aim to foster trust and integrity in the digital art space. This effort is poised to significantly aid AI innovators and content creators who are eager to fully capitalize on their work. We are working towards a system where each input prompt and its resultant content can be validated on the blockchain, aiming to ensure authenticity. This initiative paves the way for equitable revenue-sharing models for transactions involving AI-generated content NFTs.
